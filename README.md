# Spark---NLP
It is based on the Kaggle competition San Francisco Crime Classification. The dataset provides nearly 12 years of crime reports from across all
of San Francisco's neighborhoods. Given time, location, and a free text description, the challenge was to predict the category of crime that occurred,
a multiclass text classification problem. The data can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime/data .

To solve this problem, we will use key steps of Natural Language Processing along with different supervised machine learning algorithms in Spark, also use 
Cross-Validation to tune hyperparameters.
